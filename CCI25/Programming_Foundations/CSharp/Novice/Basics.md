# Basics
## Entry point
C#'s Entry point, like other languages is the `Main` function. It's the function that gets ran first whenever we start the program. For now there's no need to worry about `static`, `void` or `string[]`, it's unimportant.

Take a look at the picture below, this is what a typical C# program looks like at first:

## Data types
Variables are a container for us to store a value that belongs to a `data type`. There's two different types of value types: `value` and `reference`.

If you want to know more:
- Value types store the actual value `directly`.
- Reference types store a `reference` (memory address) that points to the value.

We can use built-in types that are defined by the language or build these data types ourselves. Sone of these types like the user-defined reference types will seem complicated at first, know that they're unimportant for now.

### Value types
Predefined:

| Real-word type | According C# keyword | Example |
|-|-|-|
| Whole numbers | `int` | `-5` or `5` |
| Floating point numbers | `float` or `double` | `-5.5` or `5.5` |
| Letters | `char` | `'A'` or `'z'` |
| Validity | `bool` | `true` or `false` |

User-Defined:

| Real-word type | According C# keyword | Example |
|-|-|-|
| A lightweight type for grouping others. | `struct` | `struct Point { public int X, Y; }` |
| A set of names constant values. | `enum` | `enum Days { Monday, Tuesday }` |

### Reference types
Predefined:

| Real-word type | According C# keyword | Example |
|-|-|-|
| Sentences (collection of letters) | `string` | `"Hello World!"` |
| A 'thing', any thing. | `object` | `"Hello World!"` or `5.5` |

User-Defined:

| Real-word type | According C# keyword | Example |
|-|-|-|
| A constructed object that can do things. | `class` | `class Dog{}` |
| A contract / rules for objects on how to behave. | `interface` | `interface Dog{}` |
| A reference to a function. | `delegate` | `public delegate int PerformCalculation(int x, int y);` |

## Variables
Wokring with variables throughout our program we will often change their values. However, we also somewhat keep track of their state.

A variable can be `declared` without a initial value:
`int a;`

Note that some types will get defaulted to a initial value like 0.

A variable can be `assigned` a value:
`a = 5;`

A variable can be `initialized` (declared with a value):
`int a = 5;`

## Operators
We can perform some calculations or variables or literal values using operators.

There's a bunch of types of operators. Usually when thinking of operators we think of `Arithmetic` operators like `plus`.

For example: `int a = 5 + 5;` or `int b = a + 5;` or `int c = a + b;`

### Arithmetic

| Name | Operator |
|-|-|
| Addition | `+` |
| Subtraction | `-` |
| Multiplication | `*` |
| Division | `/` |
| Modulus | `%` |
| Increment | `++` |
| Decrement | `--` |

### Assignment

| Name | Operator |
|-|-|
| Assignment | `=` |
| Addition assignment | `+=` |
| Subtraction assignment | `-=` |
| Multiplication assignment | `*=` |
| Division assignment | `/=` |
| Modulus assignment | `%=` |

### Comparison

| Name | Operator |
|-|-|
| Equal to | `==` |
| Not equal to | `!=` |
| Greater than | `>` |
| Less than | `<` |
| Greater than or equal to | `>=` |
| Less than or equal to | `<=` |

### Logical

| Name | Operator |
|-|-|
| Logical AND | `&&` |
| Logical OR | `\|\|` |
| Logical NOT | `!` |
