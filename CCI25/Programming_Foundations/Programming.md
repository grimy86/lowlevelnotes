# TO BE UPDATED

<!--
**prerequisites:** None

**disclaimer:** Learning a high-level language like C# isn’t necessary for low-level programming, but it can help if you find C or C++ challenging. Some prefer C++ since it has less abstraction, reducing the gap to low-level concepts.

Basics:
1. [Understanding the Language]()  
2. [Program Entry-Point]()  
3. [Variables & Data Types]()  
4. [Operators & Instruction Statements]()  
5. [Scope & Duration]()  
6. [C/C++ Header Files & Linkage]()
7. [Object lifetime]()
8. [Control Flow]()  
9. [References]()
10. [C/C++ Pointers]()  
11. [Structs & Enums]()

Object-Oriented Programming:
1. [Classes & "This"]()
2. [Fields & Methods]()
3. [Constructors & Destructors]()
4. [Encapsulation]()
5. [Inheritance]()
6. [Polymorphism]()
7. [Interfaces]()
